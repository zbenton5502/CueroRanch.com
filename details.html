        <p class="text-lg mb-4">
            For sale is a 52+ acre ranch in DeWitt County, about 8 miles north of Cuero in the Texas Blackland Prairie. The property includes a custom-built 3-bedroom, 2-bath home, 2,441 square feet, perched on a ridge with views of the Cuero Creek valley. The house has limestone on all four sides, a standing seam metal roof, and plenty of outdoor space—a front porch, back porch, and cabana area—great for taking in the countryside. The land’s dotted with mature oaks and a few pecan trees, and it rolls gently, split into three main sections with cross-fencing for livestock. Each section has access to well water.

            There’s a big metal shop with 220v power, welded supports, and two roll-up doors, plus a hay barn next to a corral with a squeeze chute. The cross-fencing, gates, barn, and troughs are laid out thoughtfully to make ranching easy and efficient. Wildlife’s all over the place—deer, dove, turkey, and ducks included—making it a haven for anyone who loves the outdoors.
